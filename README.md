We sincerely believe that everyone should have the ability to modify their website without burdening their minds with unnecessary details such as FTP parameters, the intricacies of various CMS, template handling, and other technical aspects that often become headaches for web developers. While no one prohibits you from mastering all these nuances, SiteBrush is designed to ease the resolution of routine tasks, allowing you to focus on the creative process.

Modern dynamic websites, built on popular CMS, have lost some advantages of classic static web pages edited using tools like HTML editors or even simple text editors.

The most noticeable drawbacks of dynamic websites:

* Inability to see the final result during editing, as changes are made to separate parts: templates or content.
* The need to master the specification of the used template and understand the complex markup of templates.
* Limited customization options for the design of each page.
* Similarity of many designs due to the complexity of modifying ready-made templates.
* Dynamic websites usually require significantly more resources than static sites and operate more slowly. A dynamic website can serve 10 to 500 users simultaneously, while a static website will serve 10,000 to 50,000+ users simultaneously without losing performance.
* **The most important issue is that dynamic websites are more vulnerable to attackers and can be used for purposes other than intended. A deep understanding of the nuances of applied programming languages is required to reliably secure your internet resource from unwanted interventions.**

On the other hand, static websites also have their weaknesses:

* The need to upload, edit, and reload each page, as well as master technologies such as FTP.
* The complexity of changing one element on multiple pages.
* Lack of the ability to collaborate on the site or edit from different devices.

This is why we created SiteBrush, combining the advantages of both approaches. This tool, originally developed for our own needs, is sure to appeal to you.
