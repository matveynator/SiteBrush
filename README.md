Creating a blog or a web page should be a breeze, without getting bogged down in technical jargon and complex processes. That's where SiteBrush steps in, providing you with an elegant solution for hassle-free website modification, allowing you to focus on your creative journey.

Modern dynamic websites, often built with complex CMS, might seem appealing, but they come with their share of drawbacks:

* You can't see the final result during editing, making it challenging to visualize changes.
* Understanding template specifications and complex markup can be overwhelming.
* Customizing the design for each page is limited, leading to a lack of uniqueness.
* Modifying ready-made templates is often complicated, resulting in similar-looking designs.
* Dynamic sites demand more resources and operate slower than static ones.

**Most importantly, dynamic sites are more vulnerable to security threats, requiring in-depth knowledge of programming languages to safeguard your online presence.**

On the flip side, static websites have their challenges:

* Editing each page requires manual uploading and reloading, involving SSH/FTP/Version Control and other oldschool things.
* Changing one element across multiple pages can be tedious as static pages do not support templating.
* Collaboration and editing from different devices are not straightforward.

This is where SiteBrush shines, bringing together the best of both worlds. Originally designed to meet our own needs, this tool is tailored to make your blog or web page creation experience seamless.
